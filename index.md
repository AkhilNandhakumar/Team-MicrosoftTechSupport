### Binary
* Binary is a number system based off of a base of 2
  * This means that the digits are powers of 2

### Hexadecimal
* Hexadecimal is a number system based off of a base of 16
  * This would be "0" through "9" and "A" through "F"
* Hexadecimal is used for hex color codes and we can pack more information
* We can express any number from 0 to 255 with just 2 digits
  * To do the same with binary, we would need 8 digits.

### Bit, Nibble, Byte
