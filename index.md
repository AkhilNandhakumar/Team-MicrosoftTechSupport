### Binary
* Binary is a number system based off of a base of 2
  * This means that the digits are powers of 2

### Hexadecimal
* Hexadecimal is a number system based off of a base of 16
  * This would be "0" through "9" and "A" through "F"
* Hexadecimal is used for hex color codes and we can pack more information
* We can express any number from 0 to 255 with just 2 digits
  * To do the same with binary, we would need 8 digits.

### Bit, Nibble, Byte

* A bit is one binary digit
* A nibble is four bits
* A byte is eight bits

## Data, Data Abstraction
### Data

* Data is any information that can be processed and interpreted by a computer
* Almost anything can be data (or turned into data)
  * Music
  * Texts sent to a friend
  * Or a the contacts in your phone

### Data Abstraction
* Data abstraction makes data more easily read and/or understood
* For example, a computer can take a string of bits and convert them to our alphanumeric system and then display that
  * This would be like sending a set of texts

## Lossless/Lossy Compression

* Lossless is used for when you cannot compromise on the quality of the message you are sending
  * Usually used with images
* Lossy is when you can compromise on the quality of the message.
  * Usually used with audio and video

## Metadata
* Metadata is information about other types of information
  * This could be:
   * the author, date, location, and time when a picture was taken
  * Or it could be how it was compressed and the original size
